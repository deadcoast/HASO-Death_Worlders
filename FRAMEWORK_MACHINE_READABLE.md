### Formal Mathematical Equations

**Predator Evolution Rate:**

```math
R_predator = (g_planet / g_Earth)^1.5 × (m_planet / m_Earth)^1.2

Where:
- R_predator = relative evolution speed of apex predators
- g_planet = surface gravity of planet
- g_Earth = 9.807 m/s²
- m_planet = planetary mass
- m_Earth = 5.972×10²⁴ kg
```

**Intelligent Species Extinction Rate:**

```math
E_extinction = R_predator × (t / 10)

P_survival = e^(-E_extinction)

Where:
- E_extinction = extinction pressure coefficient
- t = time elapsed in millions of years
- P_survival = probability of survival to space age
```

**The 99.9% Rule:**

```math
P_optimal = 0.999 if (0.1 ≤ m_relative ≤ 0.8)
P_death_world = 0.001 if (m_relative > 0.8)

Where:
- m_relative = m_planet / m_Earth
- 99.9% of spacefaring life evolved on 0.1-0.8 Earth mass planets
- 0.1% evolved on Death Worlds (Earth-sized or larger)
```

        }
```

**Size Scaling Equation:**

```math
h_species = h_baseline × (m_planet / m_baseline)^0.6

Where:
- h_species = average height of intelligent species
- h_baseline = reference height (e.g., 1.75m for humans)
- m_planet = planet mass
- m_baseline = reference planet mass (Earth = 1.0)

Result: Species from 0.1 Earth-mass planets ≈ 0.17m tall (17cm)
        Humans at 1.75m tall ≈ 10x larger

## SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY NOTES

```yaml
astronomy_considerations:
  - JADES-GS-z14-0 is real, discovered 2024 by JWST
  - Redshift 14.18 = ~13.5 billion years ago
  - "Dead Zone" obscuration is fictional but plausible (dark matter, cosmic noise)
  - Speed of light limitations addressed via gravity manipulation (speculative but sci-fi standard)

biology_considerations:
  - Square-cube law: Larger organisms face structural challenges
  - Gravity's effect on evolution is scientifically sound principle
  - Death World concept rooted in real astrobiology discussions
  - Size difference between species biologically possible (see: elephant vs mouse)

physics_considerations:
  - ForreFold Drive uses "Alcubierre-adjacent" warp concept
  - Gravity manipulation is theoretical but within hard sci-fi bounds
  - Miniature fusion reactors are speculative but extrapolated from current research
  - Weaponized gravity wells follow from drive mechanism logically

suspension_of_disbelief_budget:
  - FTL travel: Necessary for story, explained via gravity manipulation
  - Micro-suns: Speculative but internally consistent
  - Humanoid aliens: Common sci-fi trope, justified by convergent evolution
  - Universal translation: Not explained, assume standard sci-fi tech
```

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI CONSUMER

```python
"""
INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM CONSUMPTION:

1. PRESERVE LOGIC:
   - All mathematical formulas must remain consistent across generation
   - Size ratios (10:1 human to Aurulean) are immutable
   - Death World theory must drive all biological explanations

2. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:
   - Always follow three-act structure: Dismissal → Catalyst → Redemption
   - Humans must be underestimated initially
   - Redemption must come through action, not persuasion

3. TONE CALIBRATION:
   - Balance epic action with intimate character moments
   - Show wonder at cosmic scale alongside personal struggle
   - Avoid grimdark or pure military power fantasy
   - Include moments of humor (size difference, cultural misunderstanding)

4. EXPANDABILITY:
   - Framework supports multiple stories in same universe
   - Can introduce new Coalition species using same planet-mass formulas
   - Can explore different human traits [x] while maintaining core
   - Baegk can be replaced with other threats using similar logic

5. CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
   - Before generating, validate against ConsistencyEngine.IMMUTABLE_FACTS
   - Cross-reference species stats with BiologicalScaleFormula
   - Ensure technology comparisons maintain ForreFold Drive superiority
   - Timeline must respect 3,000-year human spaceflight vs 100,000-year Coalition

6. SCENE GENERATION:
   - Use StoryGenerationPrompts for common scene types
   - Always show, don't tell (e.g., demonstrate human strength via action)
   - Physical descriptions must reflect planet-of-origin biology
   - Emotional beats must earn their weight through setup

7. AVOIDING COMMON PITFALLS:
   - Don't make humans perfect (show struggle and cost)
   - Don't make Coalition stupid (they are advanced, just different)
   - Don't over-explain technology (some mystery is good)
   - Don't forget human vulnerability (they can be hurt/killed)

8. THEMATIC RESONANCE:
   - Every scene should reinforce "strength in diversity"
   - Show earned respect, not demanded authority
   - Highlight cost of prejudice, value of open-mindedness
   - Celebrate unconventional solutions to conventional problems
