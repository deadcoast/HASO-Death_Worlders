# CHAPTER ONE: "Through the Dark"

## SECTION 1: The Breakthrough

The containment field hit 99.97% efficiency and Sarah Chen decided she'd been holding her breath for about forty seconds too long.

"Core Four stable," she announced, because someone had to say it out loud even though everyone on the bridge could see the same readout she was staring at. "Magnetic bottles nominal. Fusion yield holding at 2.4 petawatts per reactor."

Four miniature stars. She'd helped build four miniature stars, each one crammed into a magnetic containment field the size of a shipping container, each one burning at 15.7 million Kelvin—hot enough that if the fields failed for even a microsecond, the *Tenacity* would become an expanding cloud of superheated atoms.

They'd been testing for six months. Six months living in Neptune's outer orbit in 0.3g spin-gravity that made her coffee taste weird and gave everyone on the crew persistent lower back pain. Six months of calibration sequences and failed synchronization attempts and one extremely memorable incident where Core Two spiked to 16.2 million Kelvin and Chen had physically felt her cardiovascular system attempting to evacuate her body through her throat.

But right now, at this exact moment, all four cores were synchronized within 0.03% variance. The magnetic containment wasn't even working hard.

"Gravity well projection in ninety seconds," Captain Marcus Webb said from the command chair. He sounded calm, which was either genuine or really excellent acting. Chen couldn't tell anymore. "All stations confirm ready status."

Chen pulled up the math one more time, because she'd learned a long time ago that staring at equations when you were nervous was better than staring at the people around you who were also nervous.

The theory was simple, or at least it had seemed simple when she'd presented it to the DAGR Science Council three years ago: you can't see through the Obscuration Zone's interference, so don't try. Generate localized gravity wells ahead of your ship, fall into your own artificial spacetime curvature, and slide around the interference instead of punching through it.

Everyone had agreed it was theoretically sound. Everyone had also agreed that miniaturizing stellar fusion was impossible, which was why humanity had wasted two hundred years building Dyson spheres that never quite generated enough power to matter.

Chen had spent those two hundred years—well, not personally, she was only forty-three—but humanity had spent that time proving that passive collection was for species that had time to be elegant. Earth hadn't granted that luxury.

"Gravity well one," Chen said, and activated Core One's projection system.

Space dimpled.

That was the only way to describe it. Through the engineering viewport, the void did something her visual cortex couldn't quite process—like someone had pressed their thumb into reality and left a dent.

"Well two."

Another dent. The Obscuration Zone's radiation interference, which had been screaming static on their sensors for six months, started bending around the projected gravity fields like water around stones.

"Three. Four."

The *Tenacity* lurched. Not thrust-lurched, because you didn't feel thrust with gravity manipulation. This was falling-lurched, except the direction kept changing and her inner ear was filing formal complaints with her brain about the entire situation.

"Velocity at 47c," Webb reported. His voice had that particular flavor of calm that meant he was absolutely not calm but was too professional to show it. "68c. 140c. Cores are stable, gravitational shear is within acceptable parameters, and holy shit we're actually doing this."

The last part he said quietly, probably not meaning for it to go over the shipwide channel. Chen grinned anyway.

"347c," the navigator called out. Lieutenant Okonkwo, who Chen was pretty sure hadn't blinked in the last two minutes. "Sensor resolution improving. I'm getting... hold on."

The bridge went quiet. Chen watched the sensor feed resolving on her own console. The Obscuration Zone interference was still there—300 million light-years of dark matter density anomalies and intergalactic radiation noise and gravitational lensing that had made the entire Milky Way invisible to anyone observing. But their gravity wells were bending it, folding space around the noise, creating a bubble of clear observation.

And through that bubble, Chen saw stars.

Not Earth's stars. Not the few thousand dim specks visible through the Zone's static. *Millions* of discrete light sources, organized in patterns that didn't seem familiar. Dyson swarms—the infrared signature of optimal captured stellar energy. Quantum slip-drive emissions in the specific frequency bands that meant artificial gravity manipulation. Mathematical precision that only came from intentional engineering.

"Confirm discrete contacts," Okonkwo said, and his voice cracked on the last word. "Confirmed multiple Dyson-type constructs. Confirmed artificial gravity signatures consistent with active FTL infrastructure. Confirmed—" He stopped. "Captain, I'm reading organized stellar engineering on a scale that makes our entire solar system look like a backyard project."

Chen's hands were shaking. She pressed them flat against her console because she was a professional and professionals didn't shake during first contact with alien civilizations, except apparently they absolutely did and she was going to have to make peace with that.

"We're not alone," she said.

"No," Webb said quietly. "We really aren't."

The *Tenacity* had spent three thousand years searching empty sky. Humanity had built fusion drives and antimatter engines and ForreFold gravity manipulation, had spread through Sol system and started reaching toward nearby stars, all while staring at the Obscuration Zone and wondering if anything was out there.

Three thousand years of looking at static and hoping.

"Maintain current approach," Webb ordered. "Reduce to 100c and activate first contact protocols. Someone's home, and we're about to knock on some  doors."

Chen checked the fusion containment one more time. All four cores nominal. Boring. Beautiful. Absolutely perfect.

They'd broken through the wall. Now they'd find out what was on the other side.

And Chen really, really hoped they were friendly, because the sensor readings were showing infrastructure that could probably disassemble Earth for spare parts if they wanted to.

## SECTION 2: First Detection

Kiv-Tel-Mor had been staring at flat sensors for six hours when the universe decided to make things interesting.

The gravity sensors, which normally registered the background quantum foam fluctuation that averaged out to exactly nothing, spiked to 4.7 standard deviations above baseline. Then they spiked again. And again. And again, in a pattern that was way too organized to be natural.

Kiv's respiratory spiracles sealed—an autonomic response from back when Auruleans lived in burrow-colonies and predators were something you had to worry about. Not helpful now, but evolution didn't care about helpful. Evolution cared about "survived long enough to reproduce," which Kiv's ancestors had managed by being very, very good at recognizing threats.

The sensor data made no sense. Four discrete gravity wells, each one approximately 2.3 standard masses, moving in perfect synchronization. The energy signature suggested stellar-scale fusion—which was normal for Dyson infrastructure—except these signatures were *mobile* and compressed into volumes that shouldn't be physically possible.

Miniaturized stars. Someone had built miniaturized stars.

Kiv pulled up every theoretical physics paper in the Aurulean Science Archive that mentioned stellar fusion miniaturization. The search returned forty-seven results, all of which concluded it was impossible because the energy density would cause catastrophic containment failure.

Except someone apparently hadn't read those papers, or had read them and decided "impossible" was more of a suggestion.

The contact alert shrieked. Kiv's four primary eyes focused on the biosignature scan, and his spiracles sealed even tighter.

One vessel. Crew complement approximately 40 individuals. Individual mass readings: 68 kilograms average. Height extrapolated from internal deck structure: 1.7 meters.

Kiv knew exactly what that meant because the briefing materials on Death World physiology were mandatory reading for anyone stationed at border monitoring outposts. Those were Baegk-scale biosignatures. That was Death World Class-10 minimum, possibly higher.

Three hundred years of war. Three extinct founding races. The Baegk had taught the Coalition what happened when apex predators evolved intelligence and decided the galaxy was prey.

And now something else from a Death World had just emerged from the region everyone had written off as lifeless void.

Kiv's mandibles were clicking—another stress tell, another evolutionary holdover that didn't help but wouldn't stop. He forced himself to analyze the transmission that was coming through.

Electromagnetic. Not pheromone-based hive coordination like the Baegk used. Modulated in clear mathematical patterns. Universal first contact protocol—the same framework the Coalition had used for 100,000 years, which meant whoever these people were, they either knew about the Coalition or had independently derived the same mathematical approach to initial communication.

The translator matrix processed the signal. The voice that came through was... unexpected.

"This is DAGR vessel *Tenacity* to unknown stations." Warm. Curious. The kind of tone Kiv associated with junior researchers who'd just discovered something exciting, not with Death World species emerging from nowhere. "We are human explorers from the Milky Way galaxy, Sol system, planet Earth. We... wow. Hi! We've been looking for you for a very long time. We come in peace and hope to learn from you. Can you hear us? Please respond. We're so excited to meet you!"

Kiv stared at the translation. The word "wow" didn't have a clean Aurulean equivalent—it was pure excitement without specific semantic content. And "excited" was definitely the right translation, because the harmonic patterns in their voice matched what Aurulean emotional recognition algorithms flagged as genuine enthusiasm.

They were happy.

Death World species that operated impossible technology and had just traveled through the Obscuration Zone were... happy to meet us.

Kiv triggered the priority alert to JADES-GS-z14-0 command because this was absolutely above his pay grade, then started composing a response because leaving them hanging seemed rude and also possibly strategically stupid.

"DAGR vessel *Tenacity*, this is Coalition Monitoring Station Theta-9," Kiv transmitted, and hoped the translator got the right tone of "cautiously welcoming without committing to anything." "Your transmission received. Your approach has been noted and logged. Please maintain current position while we establish formal contact protocols. Welcome to... um. Welcome to Coalition space. We're also excited to meet you. Cautiously excited. Very cautiously."

That last part probably wasn't in the official first contact script, but Kiv figured honesty was better than pretending he wasn't mildly terrified.

The response came back swift: "Understood, Station Theta-9! We're maintaining position. Take all the time you need. We've been trying to see out for three hundred years, we can wait a few more hours. This is amazing. You're amazing. Sorry, I'm—" a pause, some background noise that might have been laughter "—I'm being told to maintain professional communications protocol. Tenacity out."

Kiv watched the sensor feed. The vessel was holding position exactly as requested, all four of those impossible miniaturized stars spinning in perfect synchronization.

Death Worlders who said please and thank you and apologized for being too enthusiastic.

The Coalition was going to have no idea what to do with them.

## SECTION 3: Arrival at Primarch Station

Marcus Webb had known intellectually that he wouldn't fit through the airlock.

He'd reviewed the dimensional specifications exactly four times during the 48-hour approach to Coalition Station Primarch. He'd noted that standard Aurulean architecture was scaled for beings averaging 17 centimeters in height, which meant doorways, corridors, and basically everything else would be sized accordingly. He'd prepared himself mentally.

And then he stepped through the airlock and smacked his forehead on the door frame anyway, because knowing something intellectually and experiencing it physically were apparently very different things.

"Ow," he said, because that's what you said when you concussed yourself during first contact with an alien civilization.

Behind him, Sarah Chen made a yelp that sounded a lot like a suppressed laugh. "Permission to feel like a giant, sir?"

"Granted," Webb muttered, ducking properly this time and entering a corridor that felt like it had been designed for particularly organized mice.

Everything was precise. Clean lines, optimal angles, materials that looked engineered down to the molecular level. And every single dimension felt like Webb was visiting a very serious, very advanced dollhouse.

The welcoming committee waited in what the briefing materials had called a "central atrium," which by human standards was approximately the size of a large bathroom. Five Aurulean officials stood in what appeared to be formal diplomatic configuration, their crystalline carapaces refracting the station's light into subtle rainbow patterns that Webb's briefing materials said communicated mood, status, and social hierarchy in ways he had absolutely no ability to read.

The lead Aurulean—his HUD identified them as Ambassador Pel-Kor-Nim, Senior Diplomatic Corps—stood exactly 2.3 meters away. Webb's neural implant flagged it: optimal conversation distance for Auruleans was 0.4 meters. For humans it was 0.7 to 1.2 meters depending on cultural context.

2.3 meters was "polite distance from something you're not sure about."

Webb knelt.

It wasn't in the official protocol brief, but then again the protocol brief had been written by the DAGR Diplomatic Corps, who were all sitting safely back on Earth and not currently looking at people one-tenth their size who were clearly fighting every evolutionary instinct that said "large things are dangerous."

He knelt, slowly, trying not to make any sudden movements. His knees popped audibly. He was forty-seven, not twenty-seven. His body kept reminding him of this at inconvenient moments.

The Ambassador's posture shifted. Webb couldn't read it, but his translator implant helpfully noted: "Tension reduction observed. Threat assessment lowered."

"Ambassador Pel-Kor-Nim," Webb said, keeping his voice quiet because the acoustic briefing had been very clear that humans were *loud* to species that communicated through subsonic vibration and chemical packets. "I'm Captain Marcus Webb, representing the Democratic Alliance of Geological Republics. We're honored to meet you. Thank you for guiding us in."

The translator lag was minimal—Coalition technology was efficient like everything else here. Pel-Kor-Nim's mandibles moved in complex patterns that Webb's implant tagged as "formal diplomatic speech mode."

"Captain Webb. Your arrival has been unexpected. We have questions regarding your origin point, your technological capabilities, and your intentions in Coalition space."

Webb nodded slowly. "We're explorers. We achieved faster-than-light travel about three thousand years ago—relatively recently, I understand. We've been expanding slowly, mapping our local region. The breakthrough through what you call the 'Dead Zone' happened six months ago using a new drive system we developed. We'd be happy to share our technical data, our history, anything that helps build trust and mutual understanding."

Another pause. The Ambassador's carapace refracted light from pale blue toward slightly greenish. Webb had no idea what that meant, but his implant noted it with the helpful tag: "Emotional state shift detected. Unable to classify."

"Your physical profile matches concerning parameters," Pel-Kor-Nim said carefully. "Your mass, your skeletal density indicators, your homeworld's gravity signature. These metrics suggest Death World classification. We have historical precedent with one other Death World species. The experience has been... challenging."

The Baegk. Three hundred years of genocidal war. Three Coalition founding races extinct. Ongoing existential threat.

Webb understood the fear. He'd feel it too, if someone Baegk-sized showed up unannounced.

"We're not them," Webb said. "I understand your concern—I'd be concerned too, in your position. We'd like the opportunity to demonstrate that we're different through our actions, not just our words. We're willing to submit to any reasonable security protocols you require. We're not here to cause problems. We're here because we've been alone for three thousand years and we'd really, really like to not be alone anymore."

The last part wasn't in the diplomatic script, but Webb figured honesty was better than whatever formal speech he was supposed to give.

Pel-Kor-Nim's mandibles stilled. The carapace refraction shifted again—more green, less blue. The translator tagged it as "processing complex emotional state."

"Your cooperation is noted and appreciated," the Ambassador finally said. "The Coalition Council will convene to discuss appropriate contact protocols and provisional status guidelines. You will be provided accommodation specifications and station access parameters. Welcome, Captain Webb, to Primarch Station."

The phrasing was perfect. Formal. Careful.

And Webb noticed what wasn't said: Welcome to the Coalition. Welcome as members. Welcome home.

Just... welcome to the station. Provisionally.

Chen helped him stand once the Auruleans had departed, giving formal bows that looked carefully researched. Webb's knees popped again.

"First contact could've gone worse," Chen offered.

Webb looked down the corridor—every door frame a reminder that he was in a space not built for him, not designed with him in mind, not really meant for humans at all.

"Yeah," he said. "Could've gone better too."

---

## SECTION 4: The Queue

The fuel gauge read 23% and Marcus Webb was developing opinions about Coalition bureaucracy.

Specifically, he was developing the opinion that Coalition bureaucracy was very good at being technically non-discriminatory while practically ensuring humans stayed at the bottom of every priority queue.

Another Aurulean freighter slid past *Tenacity*'s position—that made seven Coalition vessels that had jumped the line in the past four hours. The dockmaster's explanation had been unfailingly polite: civilian traffic and Coalition defense vessels maintained priority access under standard station protocols. Estimated wait time for DAGR vessels: 18 hours.

They'd been holding position for 31 hours.

Webb checked the fuel gauge again, as if it would show a different number if he stared at it hard enough. It did not. Physics was disappointingly consistent about that kind of thing.

"Sir," Chen said from navigation, "there's a private fueling station four light-hours out. They don't offer the Coalition member discount, but—"

"But we won't spend another day watching Aurulean pleasure-craft get waved through while we burn reserves just maintaining position," Webb finished. He pulled up the commercial rates. Forty percent higher than Coalition pricing. Still cheaper than the opportunity cost. "Plot the course."

This was the pattern. Not hatred—Webb could have handled hatred. Hatred was clear. Hatred gave you something to push against.

This was something else. This was getting stuck in the slow lane while everyone else had express passes. This was "We'd love to help, but protocols, you understand." This was death by a thousand small exclusions, each one perfectly justified, none of them individually actionable.

The docking queues were just the most visible example. There were others:

Coalition medical facilities: "We apologize, but our equipment is calibrated for standard biological parameters. Treatment for Death World physiology requires specialized preparation. Estimated scheduling availability: four weeks." Meanwhile, a Velrik merchant with indigestion got seen the same day.

Coalition trade ports: "Standard infrastructure surcharge applies—reinforced platforms, enhanced safety protocols, completely reasonable given your species' mass profile." The surcharge was always exactly high enough that human goods couldn't compete with Coalition alternatives.

Coalition diplomatic councils: human proposals were received with perfect courtesy, entered into official records, and then assigned to subcommittees for "comprehensive analysis." None had ever emerged from analysis. Webb had checked.

He'd also checked the unofficial channels—the Coalition data networks that humans had gradually learned to navigate. The nicknames spread through civilian populations like wildfire:

*Demons*—the species that struck bargains with death  
*Reapers' Grin*—they paint blades on their ships  
*Death Worlders*—said with a mix of fear and contempt  
*Flying Pigs*—their vessels are too ugly for civilized space  
*Cave Men of the Void*—primitives stumbling into civilization

The initial reaction among DAGR crews had been anger, which was natural and expected and completely useless. Then someone—Webb had never learned who—painted a scythe on their cargo hauler's hull. Black blade, silver edge, stylized and brutal.

When Coalition port authority questioned it, the captain's response had entered DAGR legend: "Heard you think we're reapers. Figured we'd make it official."

Within six months, half the human fleet wore similar imagery. The *Tenacity* gained crossed daggers on her prow. DAGR engineering corps started redesigning destroyer-class vessels with reinforced forward sections and angular protrusions that looked vaguely like tusks. Official designation: Warthog-class Heavy Cruiser. Unofficial translation: you called us pigs, so we made them mean.

The Coalition wanted humanity ashamed of being Death Worlders?

Fine. Humanity would own it.

Chen's console chimed. "Private station confirms docking clearance in ninety minutes."

"Acknowledged." Webb logged the cost against their mission budget—another hit to resources that Coalition vessels never faced. He added a note to the patrol log: *Coalition Station Primarch, 31-hour queue delay. Pattern consistent with previous fourteen incidents.*

He didn't add the personal observation: this was precisely calibrated. Long enough to be inconvenient. Not long enough to be legally actionable discrimination. Coalition officials would point to their regulations, their safety procedures, their resource constraints. All technically accurate. All practically ensuring humans stayed peripheral.

The *Tenacity* broke from the queue and turned toward the private station that would take human currency without the wait. Behind them, Coalition Station Primarch continued its efficient operations, serving its member species with the smooth precision of 100,000 years of institutional experience.

Humanity learned to find its own way.

Webb checked the fuel gauge one more time. 22% now.

"Practicality over design," he muttered.

Chen glanced over. "Sir?"

"Nothing," Webb said. "Just reminding myself why we're good at this."

---

## SECTION 5: First Welcome

Sarah Chen had learned not to expect warmth from first contact scenarios. The Coalition had been polite—very polite, extremely polite, so polite that it had taken Chen three weeks to realize that "polite" and "welcoming" were completely different things.

So when the Portavian research vessel's transmission came through with actual curiosity instead of careful diplomatic distance, Chen's first instinct was to check the translation matrix for errors.

"Human-Chen," the voice rendered through her neural implant, "your published paper on gravitational lensing applications in the Coalition Scientific Forum contained an approach we had not previously considered. We would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your methodology, if you are willing."

No preamble about security protocols. No questions about Death World origin or potential threat assessment. Just... interest in the science.

Chen pulled up the Portavian vessel's specifications. The *Axiom-Seeker* was small—barely 40 meters, designed for a crew of beings that averaged 12 centimeters in height. She was going to have to navigate corridors built for creatures smaller than her hand, which should probably feel weirder than it did after two years in Coalition space.

The lead researcher—Mathematician-Philosopher Ven-Tal-Kir, according to the introduction transmission—waited in what the ship's layout designated as a "collaborative workspace." Chen had to crawl through the access corridor, which was dignified and exactly what she'd signed up for when she joined the DAGR Science Corps.

Ven-Tal-Kir's body was crystalline, silicon-based biology that refracted light into prismatic patterns. Smaller than an Aurulean, which Chen hadn't thought was possible. And standing less than a meter away, which was... new. The Auruleans always maintained 2+ meters of distance. The Velrik she'd met had averaged 3 meters. Everyone in Coalition space seemed to have developed a personal-space bubble that factored in "stay away from the giant Death Worlder."

Ven-Tal-Kir apparently hadn't gotten that memo.

Chen knelt automatically. Two years of practice had made it reflex.

"Please," Ven-Tal-Kir said, and the translator caught something in their harmonic patterns that sounded almost amused. "You need not lower yourself. We do not fear you."

*We do not fear you.*

Four words that hit harder than Chen expected. Not "we're managing our fear through protocols." Not "we're being polite despite our concerns." Just... no fear.

"You're the first to say that," Chen admitted.

"The Coalition judges you by the Baegk precedent. We find this approach logically insufficient." Ven-Tal-Kir's body shifted, light refracting through new angles. "We are scientists. We evaluate based on evidence. Your species achieved interstellar flight in 3,000 years. Our own civilization required 200,000 years to accomplish equivalent technological development. This is not primitive behavior. This is remarkable compression of innovation timelines."

They spent six hours discussing Chen's paper. Actually discussing it—not the careful procedural questions Coalition officials used, where you could tell they were checking boxes on a threat assessment form. Ven-Tal-Kir asked real questions. Technical questions. The kind of questions that meant they'd actually read the paper and understood the math.

When Chen explained how humanity had abandoned Dyson sphere construction after two hundred years of diminishing returns, pivoting instead to miniaturized fusion, Ven-Tal-Kir's response was immediate: "Practical adaptation over aesthetic adherence. You optimized for results rather than following established methodological frameworks."

"We call it 'practicality over design,'" Chen said. "We didn't have time for the elegant approach."

"Because your Death World environment created persistent resource pressure and existential threat, necessitating rapid iteration cycles." Ven-Tal-Kir's light patterns shifted. "Fascinating. We spent 50,000 years perfecting our quantum computational architecture. You compress equivalent breakthroughs into centuries. Not because your species possesses superior cognitive capacity—because you had no alternative."

It was the most honest assessment of humanity Chen had heard from any Coalition species. No fear-laden comparisons to the Baegk. No dismissive "primitive Death Worlders" rhetoric. Just accurate analysis of how different evolutionary contexts produced different innovation strategies.

"We would like to propose regular knowledge exchange," Ven-Tal-Kir continued. "Your ForreFold Drive principles suggest approaches to gravity manipulation our civilization never explored. In return, we can share our quantum computational frameworks and theoretical physics models. Mutual benefit through collaborative research."

Chen felt something she hadn't felt since arriving in Coalition space: hope that first contact didn't have to mean defensive posturing and careful distance.

"I'd like that," she said. "My government would too. We've been... it's been difficult, integrating into Coalition society."

"The Coalition is risk-averse by necessity, given their historical experience with the Baegk threat. Understandable, but limiting." Ven-Tal-Kir's patterns shifted again—contemplative, if Chen was learning to read them correctly. "We Portavians have existed for 500,000 years. We built computational megastructures attempting to answer fundamental questions about reality itself. And in all that time, we never encountered another species that compressed innovation cycles the way yours does. You are... refreshing."

For the first time since breaking through the Obscuration Zone, Chen felt *welcomed* instead of *tolerated*.

The knowledge exchange began immediately. Portavian quantum theory met human practical engineering. Within weeks, joint research produced hybrid approaches neither species could have developed independently. The Portavians shared freely, asked questions without hidden agendas, and treated human researchers like colleagues instead of potential threats.

This should have been what first contact with the Coalition felt like.

Instead, it became what Chen learned first contact *could* be, when fear didn't dictate every interaction.

Her neural implant logged the date: two years, four months, seven days since humanity arrived in Coalition space.

First genuine welcome: received from species that didn't have "protocols" or "security concerns" or "appropriate caution."

Just... welcome.

Chen was going to remember this.

## SECTION 6: The Silent Call

Marcus Wright's coffee hit the deck at 0213 station time, which was how Station Cassini-7's night shift learned about the Portavian genocide.

Wright had been monitoring passive sensors for six hours—the kind of quiet deep-space duty where "exciting" usually meant a micrometeorite shower or maybe a particularly interesting cosmic ray burst. Cassini-7 existed forty light-years into the Obscuration Zone, part of DAGR's methodical expansion through the region Coalition species still called the Dead Zone, mapping interference patterns and establishing listening posts.

The emergency transmission came through on Coalition frequencies. Priority Alpha. Unencrypted, which meant either catastrophic systems failure or deliberate mass broadcast to anyone who could hear.

Wright pulled up the signal. The translator matrix struggled—Portavian linguistic encoding, compressed for bandwidth efficiency, harmonic distortion that his pattern recognition software flagged as emotional stress.

He ran it through cleanup filters and listened again:

"EMERGENCY TRANSMISSION - PRIORITY ALPHA  
FROM: Portavian Remnant Fleet  
TO: Galactic Coalition Emergency Response

Primity has fallen. Baegk forces have committed total genocide against our homeworld. Surface installations destroyed. Population centers eliminated. We are refugees. We have no weapons. No defenses. We require immediate sanctuary. By Coalition Charter Article 7, we formally request emergency asylum. Please. We are dying. Anyone. Please respond."

Wright checked the timestamp. The transmission had been broadcasting for 18 days.

He pulled up Coalition military frequencies, expecting to see emergency response coordination, fleet movements, rescue operations.

Normal traffic. Civilian shipping updates. Routine patrol reports. Nothing that suggested anyone was mobilizing to help 4.2 million refugees being hunted by the Baegk.

Wright's hands were shaking. He forced them still and pulled up the Coalition Emergency Council records. They were public—Coalition governance operated on transparency principles, which was great right up until you saw something like this:

**MOTION**: Coalition Emergency Military Intervention - Portavian Refugee Crisis  
**DATE**: 16 days ago  
**AYES**: 2  
**NAYS**: 47  
**ABSTENTIONS**: 13  
**RESULT**: MOTION FAILED

The Aurulean First Speaker's statement was attached:

    *"The Portavians have our deepest sympathies. However, we must consider strategic realities. Engaging the Baegk fleet in open battle would require deploying 60% of our military forces. This would leave our core worlds vulnerable to secondary attack. We cannot risk Aurulean colonies for Portavian refugees. I am sorry, but Aurulean forces will NOT engage."*

Once the Auruleans refused, everyone else had followed. Velrik: insufficient fleet strength. Chronians: contingent on collective action. Thurani: abstain. Species after species calculating risk-reward ratios and deciding their own security mattered more than 4.2 million people dying in the void.

Wright pulled up the refugee fleet's trajectory. They were moving toward the Obscuration Zone—probably hoping to lose the Baegk in the interference, not knowing humans had listening posts scattered throughout the region now.

He composed his report to DAGR Command with hands that wouldn't quite steady. Standard format: situation summary, strategic implications, recommended actions.

Then he added a personal note, knowing it would get flagged for command attention:

    *"Sir, these are the people who welcomed us when the Coalition wouldn't. These are the scientists who treated Dr. Chen like a colleague instead of a threat. They're being hunted, and everyone with the power to help voted to let them die. Request immediate escalation to Prime Marshal Flint. We have to do something."*

Eighteen days the Coalition had debated while Portavians fled for their lives. Eighteen days of parliamentary procedure and risk assessment and strategic consideration.

Wright checked the distress call again. Still broadcasting. Still unanswered.

He looked at the timestamp ticking forward: 18 days, 4 hours, 23 minutes.

The Coalition was going to let them die.

Wright transmitted his report to DAGR Command, then pulled up the Portavian research vessel *Axiom-Seeker*'s last known position. They'd been in Sol system three weeks ago, conducting joint research with Dr. Chen on quantum-gravity computational matrices.

He wondered if Ven-Tal-Kir was on one of those refugee ships. If they were still alive. If they were wondering why no one was answering their call.

The coffee was spreading across the deck, mixing with the station's recycled atmosphere. Wright didn't clean it up.

He just watched the timestamp tick forward and waited for DAGR Command to respond.
