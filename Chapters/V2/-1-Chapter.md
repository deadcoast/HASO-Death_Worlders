# CHAPTER ONE: "THROUGH THE DARK"

## PART ONE: THE BREAKTHROUGH

Dr. Sarah Chen pressed her palm against the observation window, watching the four micro-suns spin in their magnetic cradles. Each one burned at fifteen million Kelvin—miniature replicas of Sol itself, contained in fields so precise that a single micron of drift would mean catastrophic failure. The containment readouts flickered green across her heads-up display. Stable. All four reactors humming in perfect synchronization.

Three thousand years. That's how long humanity had stared at empty skies, wondering if we were alone.

"Power output holding at 2.4 petawatts per core," announced Lieutenant Marcus Odinsson from the engineering console. His fingers danced across holographic controls, making micro-adjustments to the magnetic field geometry. "Fuel consumption nominal. We could run this for fifty years without refueling."

Chen allowed herself a tight smile. Fifty years. The Coalition—if they existed—had reportedly been spacefaring for over a hundred thousand years, building Dyson swarms and quantum slip drives. Humanity had tried that approach. Two centuries of attempting to construct passive solar collectors, watching energy trickle in at glacial rates while the engineering challenges mounted exponentially.

Then someone asked the obvious question: What if we stopped trying to harvest stars and just... made our own?

Practicality over design. Always.

"ForreFold spooling sequence initiating," called out Dr Chen from the helm. The *Tenacity* shuddered as the four micro-suns began their coordinated dance, gravitational fields reaching out ahead of the ship like invisible hands. "Gravity wells forming at mark one hundred thousand klicks."

Captain Marcus Webb stood at the center of the bridge, hands clasped behind his back. He was tall even for a human—one point nine meters, a weathered build influenced from an upbringing on Luna Station where 0.16g required constant effort to maintain consistent bone density. "Dr. Chen, are we certain about the math?"

Chen turned from the window. "As certain as we can be, sir. These new readings show Obscuration Anomaly bordering the Milky Way isn't just empty dense radiation shrouds—it's a gravity well. Sir... this new data shows evidence of a gravity well that stretches for five-hundred-million-light-years. Our existence in Sol bends, redirects time and space to everyone outside it. We must be ghosts to the known. For three thousand years mankind has looked to the stars, questioning if we are alone. All this time we have been hidden... by sheer chance. Just a bit closer, and well be able to see more-"

"The ForreFold Drive doesn't need to see through it," Webb finished.

"Sir?" Chen pulled up a holographic model of the space ahead. The Obscuration Anomaly appeared invisible to the naked eye, to the *Tenasity's* sensors; a roiling mass of red and black, like a cosmic bruise stretched across the void. 

"Your drives, Dr. Chen, to my understanding the ForreFold utilize gravitational bending?" Webb smirked a bit.

"Yes, sir. Through a chemical reaction similar to our sun, the tricky part was containing the-" Chen answered nervously but Webb interrupted.

"Confirmation Zeta_First-C" Webb routinely spouted off, not giving way or context to the gravity of the statement. "Chen, status of ForreFold drive operation with new proximal data?"

"98% status calibration, 99... Data reads show ForreFold drives...." Chen paused. "EUREKA!" she screamed as she stood with both arms raised, something about scientific traditions. "Marcus-err, Captain" Chen studdered nervously, gently nodding at Webb. "We-we've done it. New data shows ForreFold drive operates on identical principles as Obscuration Anomaly; Gravity Wells."

Webb's slight grin spread into a teethy smile. "Democratic Alliance of the Geological Republic; DAGR Exploration vessel Tenacity reporting Zeta_First-C is confirmed, ForreFold Drive confirmed nominal operations. Escalating mission directive to CLASSIFIED-Prime_First-C." Webb paused to look at his crew for a moment, a pause to heed any objections. When none followed, he turned to Chen.

"Set a course, Dr. Chen. Signal Officer, broadcast force override; all frequencies." Webb adjusted his collar, then turned to the bridge knowing the weight of his next words.

"Tenacity, this is Captain Marcus Webb. Today we etch our footprint into the histories of Mankind. On this day, humanity no longer belongs to the Milky Way and its mysteries. Today the Dominion of man is reborn with eyes that see true vision. Today we stop asking questions to answers, and start seeking them out..." Webb delivered his speech to 255 billion people. Most of the human species, from the home planet of Earth, to the far reaches of the outer cluster colonies, were listening. The age old question was nearing its final answer, and no human soul could resist the temptation of age old mysteries. When he was finished, his chest unpuffed, his granite jawline unclenched, he slouched into the captains chair and exhaled, smiling in turn to chen.

"And if the math is wrong?"

Chen met his eyes. "Then we'll find out in about thirty seconds, sir."

Webb nodded slowly, then turned to address the bridge crew. Forty-three people, all of them volunteers, all of them knowing that *Tenacity* might simply vanish into the void and never return. It wasnt ideal but someone had to do it. Practical over elegant. That was humanity's philosophy, but it didn't mean they were reckless.

Well. Not *completely* reckless.

"All hands, this is the captain," Webb said, his voice carrying through every deck via shipboard comm. "We're about to attempt something that's never been done before. We're going to navigate through the Obscuration Zone using nothing but our own gravity manipulation and a whole lot of hope. If there's anyone out there—if the galaxy is really as full of life as our xenobiologists have been theorizing for centuries—we're about to be the first humans to say hello."

He paused, then added with a slight smile: "And if there's nobody out there? Well, we've still just proven that humans can build portable stars and weaponize spacetime curvature. I'd call that a pretty good Tuesday. Commander Wei, take us through."

"Aye, sir. ForreFold Drive engaging in three... two... one..."

The four micro-suns flared in unison. Chen felt it in her bones—a sensation like falling, but in every direction at once. The observation windows showed space itself rippling, light bending in ways that made her inner ear scream warnings about gravity that wasn't there. The *Tenacity* lurched forward, not with thrust but with *inevitability*, like water flowing downhill except the hill was a gravity well they'd created ahead of themselves.

The Obscuration Zone filled the forward view. Radiation static. Gravitational lensing distortions. The cosmic microwave background noise that had blocked humanity's telescopes for three millennia.

And then—

*Reality folded.*

Chen's stomach tried to exit through her throat. The bridge lights flickered. Someone retched into a disposal bag. The ForreFold Drive screamed as it held four miniature stars in perfect synchronization while bending the fundamental structure of spacetime around the ship.

Fifteen seconds. That's how long the fold lasted.

When space unfolded again, the sensor consoles exploded with data.

"HOLY—" Lieutenant Odinsson caught himself, professionalism barely winning over shock. "Captain, sensors are... we're reading organized electromagnetic emissions. Thousands of them. Artificial constructs. Dyson swarm configurations. Quantum slip-drive signatures across multiple wavelengths."

Chen was already at his station, hands shaking as she pulled up the analysis. Stars. Millions of them, suddenly visible. But not just stars—*structures*. Massive orbital rings. Habitation spheres. Energy collectors that dwarfed Earth's moon. And ships. Hundreds of ships moving in coordinated patterns that screamed *civilization*.

"We're not alone," she whispered.

Webb moved to her side, staring at the data flood. His expression was carefully controlled, but Chen had served with him long enough to see the wonder in his eyes. "Position?"

"Analyzing stellar patterns now," said Navigation Officer Kim Park. Her voice was steady, but her hands flew across controls with barely-contained excitement. "Cross-referencing with pre-Obscuration astronomical databases... Captain, we're approximately thirteen point five billion light-years from Earth. We're in the constellation Fornax region, near the coordinates of JADES-GS-z14-0."

The bridge went silent.

JADES-GS-z14-0. The farthest confirmed galaxy ever observed by the James Webb Space Telescope back in 2024. A galaxy so ancient that its light came from just three hundred million years after the Big Bang. Humanity had been staring at its redshifted image for a century, never knowing that it was home to...

"Life," Chen said. "It's full of life."

"Broadcast our first contact package," Webb ordered. "All frequencies. Standard mathematical primers, then the linguistic database. Let's see if anyone's home."

Communications Officer Sarah Abara nodded, her dark fingers moving with practiced precision despite the tremor Chen could see in them. "Transmitting now, sir. Package includes: prime number sequences, hydrogen emission line markers, mathematical constants, and... sir, I'm also including the holographic image sequence showing Earth, our solar system, and a human being for scale reference."

"Good thinking. If they're out there, they should know what we look like." Webb settled into his command chair, then keyed the shipboard comm again. "All hands, this is the captain. We have successfully navigated the Obscuration Zone. We are currently in what appears to be heavily populated space near the JADES-GS-z14-0 region. First contact protocols are now in effect. Everyone stay sharp, stay professional, and remember—we're representing our entire species right now. Make us proud."

Chen returned to the observation window, staring out at a sky that suddenly, impossibly, wasn't empty. Three thousand years of loneliness, ended in fifteen seconds of folded spacetime.

Her comm chirped. "Dr. Chen, this is sensor analysis. You need to see this."

She pulled up the feed on her personal display and felt her breath catch. The sensors had isolated one of the nearby structures—a space station, massive and elegant, covered in what looked like bioluminescent patterns. And it was moving. Actively adjusting its position.

Toward them.

"Captain," she called out, "we have company."

---

## PART TWO: FIRST CONTACT

The response came eighteen minutes later—exactly the time light needed to travel from *Tenacity's* position to the nearest station and back. That told Chen everything about their technology level: they used light-speed communication, at least for first contact situations. Cautious. Smart.

The transmission was dense. Mathematical sequences, chemical formulas, atomic structures. Universal constants expressed in different notation but unmistakably correct. And then—images.

The first image made Chen's heart sink.

It showed a being. Bipedal. Four limbs. Two eyes. Clearly intelligent, clearly technological. But small. Very small. The scale reference included in their transmission showed the being standing next to a structure that Chen's database identified as approximately one meter tall.

The being itself was seventeen centimeters.

"Oh no," she breathed.

Webb was already at her station, staring at the same image. "How accurate is this?"

"Cross-referencing their scale markers with universal constants... Captain, this appears to be precise. If their biology follows similar efficiency curves to ours, and if their planet's gravity is proportionally lower..." She ran the calculations, fingers flying. "Sir, if this is representative of the average species here, and if our Death World Theory equations hold, then their home world would be approximately zero-point-one Earth masses. Surface gravity around zero-point-nine-eight meters per second squared."

Webb was quiet for a long moment. Then: "How tall are we, Dr. Chen?"

"Average human height, one-point-seven-five meters, sir."

"And they're..."

"Seventeen centimeters." Chen felt something cold settle in her stomach. "We're ten times their size, Captain."

The bridge crew had gone very quiet. Everyone was reading the same data, coming to the same conclusion. Humanity had just traveled thirteen-point-five billion light-years, broken through a cosmic barrier that had isolated Earth since before humans even existed, and made first contact with an advanced galactic civilization.

And to them, humans would look like *giants*.

"Sir," Abara said quietly, "we're receiving a secondary transmission. It's... it's a query. They're asking about our biology. They want to know our planet of origin's specifications."

Webb straightened. "Send them the full data package. Planet Earth, five-point-nine-seven-two times ten to the twenty-fourth kilograms mass. Surface gravity nine-point-eight-zero-seven meters per second squared. Atmospheric composition, temperature ranges, the works. And include human biological specifications—height, mass, bone density, everything."

"Sir," Chen interjected carefully, "are we sure we want to lead with that? If the Death World Theory holds—and everything we're seeing suggests it does—Earth would be classified as..."

"A Death World. I know." Webb's jaw was set. "But we don't start this relationship with lies or omissions. They'll find out eventually. Better they know from the start what we are."

Chen nodded. Practical over elegant. Even when the practical choice was terrifying.

The data package transmitted. This time, the response took longer. Twenty-two minutes. Chen imagined whatever served as their mission control frantically recalculating, running probability checks, possibly arguing about whether the massive creatures in the strange ship were even possible.

When the reply came, it was brief. A single mathematical sequence, one that Chen recognized immediately: it was the formula for predator evolution rate as a function of planetary mass and gravity.

They were asking if humanity understood what Earth was. What we were.

"Send them back an affirmative," Webb ordered. "And add our own formula—the intelligent species survival probability calculation. Show them we know exactly how unlikely our existence is."

Another transmission, another wait. And then—finally—coordinates. An invitation.

"They want us to follow them," Abara reported. "They're sending an escort. Three vessels, outbound now from that station."

On the main view screen, three ships detached from the elegant station. They were beautiful—all curves and flowing lines, like someone had asked an artist to design spacecraft based on organic forms. Each one was maybe fifty meters long, tiny compared to *Tenacity's* two hundred and forty meter bulk.

As they approached, sensors got better resolution. Chen pulled up the internal scans and immediately wished she hadn't.

The ships were full of the small beings. Dozens of them, all seventeen centimeters tall, all moving with purpose through corridors and chambers that looked impossibly delicate. She could see what appeared to be command centers, engineering stations, living quarters—all scaled to their size.

One of the beings was visible through what might have been an observation port. It was staring at *Tenacity*.

Chen zoomed the image, enhanced it, cleaned up the interference. The being's face resolved clearly.

It looked terrified.

"Captain," she said quietly, "I think we need to be very, very careful about how we proceed."

Webb nodded slowly. "Agreed. Commander Wei, match their course and speed exactly. No sudden movements. Lieutenant Odinsson, power down the ForreFold Drive to standby—I don't want them thinking we're preparing for combat jumps. Everyone else, look professional but non-threatening if you can manage it."

The escort led them deeper into the cluster of stations and constructs. Chen watched in awe as they passed structure after structure, each one a masterwork of engineering. Habitation rings spinning for artificial gravity. Agricultural spheres growing what looked like crops under carefully tuned light. Manufacturing stations with external construction bays where new ships were being assembled.

And everywhere—*everywhere*—those small beings moving about their business, occasionally stopping to stare at the enormous human vessel passing through their space.

"We're being scanned," announced Lieutenant Odinsson. "Multiple sources. Active sensors, passive radiation analysis, what looks like quantum entanglement probes. They're being very thorough."

"Let them look," Webb said. "We've got nothing to hide."

Forty minutes later, the escort brought them to a massive structure that dwarfed everything else in the immediate region. It was a ring, perhaps ten kilometers in diameter, rotating slowly. The scale was breathtaking—and then Chen realized that to the small beings, this was probably equivalent to a city-sized station. For them, it was simply proportionate.

"Receiving docking instructions," Abara reported. "They're... they're asking us to hold position at the outer marker. They say they need to, quote, 'prepare adequate facilities for your physical requirements.'"

Webb smiled slightly. "Translation: they need to figure out how to accommodate beings ten times their size. Send acknowledgment. Tell them we're happy to wait, and we appreciate their hospitality."

*Tenacity* settled into a holding pattern two hundred kilometers from the station. Through the observation ports, Chen could see small ships coming and going—traffic that hadn't stopped despite the appearance of an enormous alien vessel. Daily life continuing. That was somehow reassuring.

"Dr. Chen," Webb said, "start putting together a cultural contact team. I want xenoanthropologists, linguists, anyone with diplomatic training. Keep it to a group of ten—I don't want to overwhelm them with numbers. And for the love of Newton, make sure everyone understands the size issue. The last thing we need is someone making a sudden movement and terrifying our hosts."

"Yes, sir. I'll—" Chen stopped. "Sir, we're receiving another transmission. It's addressed to you specifically. They're... they're asking if you would be willing to come aboard their station. With a small delegation. They've prepared what they call an 'appropriately scaled meeting chamber.'"

Webb stood. "Tell them I would be honored. Dr. Chen, looks like you're on the cultural contact team. Let's go meet our neighbors."

---

## PART THREE: THE SIZE PROBLEM

The shuttle bay doors of *Tenacity* opened, revealing a small human transport—the *Curiosity*, designed for exactly this purpose. Captain Webb led a team of nine others: Dr. Chen, Lieutenant Odinsson, three xenobiologists, two linguists, a cultural anthropologist, and a security officer who looked deeply uncomfortable about the entire situation.

Chen understood the feeling. The moment they'd stepped out of *Tenacity's* familiar corridors into the shuttle, she'd felt it—that primal awareness that they were about to enter a space not built for them. The escort ships had transmitted detailed specifications for the docking bay they'd prepared, and the numbers were sobering.

The ceiling height was three meters. For the station's normal inhabitants, that was generous. For humans? It was barely manageable.

"Remember," Webb said as the shuttle approached the station, "we are guests. We move carefully, we speak softly, and we under no circumstances touch anything without permission. These people have gone to significant effort to accommodate us. Let's show them we're worth the trouble."

The *Curiosity* slid through the docking port—a port that had clearly been hastily modified, with reinforced structural members visible around the entrance. Someone had done engineering calculations on very short notice to determine what mass and volume their docking clamps needed to handle. Impressive work.

The shuttle settled onto the deck with a gentle thump. Through the viewports, Chen could see the reception committee.

There were dozens of them. Small figures—so small—standing in organized groups. They wore what appeared to be formal attire: fitted garments in iridescent materials that caught the light in fascinating ways. Many held what might have been recording devices. All of them were staring at the shuttle with expressions Chen's xenopsychology training said she should *not* attempt to interpret without more data.

But she was human, and humans read faces instinctively, even alien faces.

They looked scared.

"Exterior atmosphere reading as compatible," announced the shuttle pilot. "Oxygen-nitrogen mix, slightly higher CO2 than Earth standard but well within tolerance. Temperature twenty-two Celsius. Pressure one-point-zero-two atmospheres. We're good to disembark, Captain."

Webb stood, and even in the shuttle's human-scaled interior, his one-point-nine meter height made him the tallest person present. "Let's make history."

The shuttle ramp lowered.

Chen followed Webb down, her boots clanging softly on the metal. The first thing that hit her was the scale. The docking bay was *huge*—to the small beings. To her, it felt like walking into a large room with a low ceiling. The second thing was the smell: something sweet and slightly metallic, mixed with what might have been ozone. Alien. Definitively, undeniably alien.

And then there were the beings themselves.

Up close, they were even more delicate than the images suggested. Their skin had an iridescent quality, catching light and refracting it in subtle prismatic patterns. Large eyes—proportionally huge compared to their small heads—regarded the humans with what Chen's training said was probably fear mixed with intense curiosity. They had four limbs like humans, but the proportions were all different: longer arms relative to body size, slender fingers with an extra joint.

Beautiful. They were beautiful in a way that made Chen's heart ache. And so small. One of the younger ones—Chen guessed at youth based on body proportions and behavior—clung to what was probably a parent figure, staring up at the humans like a child might stare at a walking skyscraper.

Webb took two steps forward, then stopped. Chen saw him assess the situation in real-time: humans standing, looking down at beings who barely reached their knees. The wrong optics. The wrong everything.

Without a word, Webb knelt.

It took him down from one-point-nine meters to maybe one meter. Still twice the height of the tallest being present, but no longer looming. No longer towering.

Chen saw the visible ripple through the reception committee. Surprise. And something that might have been relief.

One of the beings stepped forward. Older, Chen guessed—there was something about the way it moved that suggested authority and experience. It wore more elaborate garments than the others, with what might have been rank insignia or cultural markers. When it spoke, its voice was high-pitched—frequencies at the upper range of human hearing—but the small translation device on Chen's collar immediately began processing.

"Welcome," the device rendered in slightly stilted English. "I am First Science Administrator Velix of Station Primarch, Aurula-Prime colonial node, Galactic Coalition Scientific Monitoring Command. You are... you are the first beings to successfully traverse the Dead Zone in recorded history. You are also..." A pause. "You are from a Death World."

Webb remained kneeling, keeping himself at a less threatening height. "I am Captain Marcus Webb of the DAGR vessel *Tenacity*, representing the Democratic Alliance of Geological Republics, Earth origin, Sol System. We are human. And yes—Earth is classified in our own xenobiology assessments as a Death World Class-Ten. We understand this is... unusual."

"Unusual." Velix made a sound that the translator didn't catch—possibly their equivalent of a laugh or a cough. "Captain Webb, in one hundred and fourteen thousand years of Coalition space exploration, we have encountered exactly one other species that evolved on a Death World. Those beings currently represent an existential threat to our entire civilization. They have driven three founding Coalition species to complete extinction over a three-hundred-year war. Forgive our... caution."

Chen felt her stomach drop. They weren't just scared because humans were big. They were scared because humanity looked like their worst nightmare made real.

Webb's expression didn't change, but Chen knew him well enough to see the calculation happening behind his eyes. "I understand your concern, First Administrator. The beings you're describing—what do you call them?"

"The Baegk. Death World Class-Twelve origin. Your size with our fear, Captain. That is what we see when we look at you."

For a long moment, nobody moved. The weight of three thousand years of human loneliness, the triumph of breaking through the Obscuration Zone, the joy of discovering that Earth wasn't alone in the universe—all of it balanced against the sudden, crushing realization that humanity's first impression on galactic civilization was *terror*.

Then the young being that had been clinging to its parent made a sound—curiosity overcoming fear—and broke away, moving toward Webb with the kind of fearless innocence that transcends species.

The parent tried to grab it back, but the young one was faster. It approached Webb's kneeling form, tilted its head, and reached out one small hand toward his knee.

Webb went absolutely still. Chen held her breath. The security officer's hand moved fractionally toward his sidearm, then froze when Chen shot him a warning glance.

The small hand touched Webb's knee. The young being's eyes went wide—probably feeling the density of human bone, the mass and solidity that came from evolving under nine-point-eight meters per second squared of gravity. It looked up at Webb's face, and Webb looked back.

And then Webb did something that Chen would remember for the rest of her life.

He smiled. Not a diplomatic smile. Not a carefully calibrated expression of non-threat. Just a genuine, warm smile—the kind a person might give to any curious child being brave enough to approach something new and strange.

The young being made a trilling sound and smiled back. Or at least, it made an expression that was probably a smile. Different facial structure, different muscles, but the intent was unmistakable.

The parent rushed forward, scooping up the young one and backing away rapidly while making apologetic sounds. Velix was speaking rapidly in their own language—probably something about protocols and safety.

But Chen saw the change. The slight relaxation in postures. The way some of the beings moved fractionally closer rather than maintaining distance. It was a tiny moment, a child's curiosity and an adult's kindness, but it had somehow shifted the entire dynamic.

Webb rose slowly, carefully, making sure not to make any sudden movements. "First Administrator Velix, I understand your concerns about Death World species. I cannot speak for the Baegk—we know nothing about them. But I can tell you about humans. We evolved on a planet that tried to kill us every single day. We survived predators, diseases, natural disasters, and a gravity well that most of your species would find crushing. We made it to the stars in three thousand years because we had no choice—we innovate or die. But here's the important part: we survived because we learned to protect each other. To cooperate. To see beyond immediate threats and work toward common goals." He paused. "We are not the Baegk. I hope, in time, we can prove that to you."

Velix was quiet for a moment, those large eyes studying Webb with an intensity that made Chen wonder exactly how much information those enhanced sensory organs were processing. Finally: "Time. Yes. Perhaps that is what is needed. Captain Webb, the Coalition Council has requested your presence at an emergency session. They wish to... assess humanity's petition for contact status."

"We would be honored to attend."

"The session will convene in six standard intervals. That should give us time to prepare appropriate accommodations." Velix gestured toward a set of doors that were, Chen noted, being hastily modified by work crews visible in the corridor beyond. "In the meantime, perhaps you and your delegation would consent to a cultural exchange? We have many questions about Death World Earth. And I suspect you have many questions about the Coalition."

Webb nodded. "We do. Starting with: how do we avoid accidentally breaking everything in your station? We're not used to infrastructure built for beings your size."

For the first time, Velix made a sound the translator labeled as "[amusement]". "A refreshingly practical concern, Captain. Come. We have prepared what we hope is an adequately reinforced facility. Your engineers transmitted your mass and density specifications—quite impressive, by the way. Our structural analysis teams have had a very exciting few hours."

As they followed Velix deeper into the station, Chen found herself hyperaware of every movement. The corridors were wide enough—just barely—but the ceiling made her want to duck even though she wasn't quite tall enough to hit it. Everything was delicate: the wall panels, the lighting fixtures, the handrails that would probably break if she put her full weight on them.

They passed other beings in the corridors. All of them stopped to stare. Some moved quickly out of the way, pressing against walls. Others stood frozen, tracking the humans with those large eyes. And the humans, for their part, moved with exaggerated care, speaking in low voices, trying to make themselves as non-threatening as possible.

It was exhausting.

The "reinforced facility" turned out to be a conference chamber that had clearly been designed for human specifications on very short notice. The ceiling was five meters high. The furniture was human-scaled, though Chen noticed the joints and structural members were significantly overbuilt—they'd taken no chances with the weight calculations. A table large enough for ten humans to sit comfortably dominated the center of the room.

At the far end of the table was a smaller setup: tables and chairs scaled for the Auruleans, with steps leading up to the main table surface so they could be at eye level with seated humans.

Velix climbed the steps—Chen saw they'd even installed a railing, sized appropriately—and settled into one of the small chairs. Several other Aurulean officials followed. From their elevated position, they were now roughly at head height with the seated humans.

"Better," Velix said. "Eye contact is important for diplomatic communication, yes? Our xenopsychology teams advised this configuration."

"It's very thoughtful," Webb said. "Thank you."

And for the next four hours, they talked.

Chen had been in first contact simulations dozens of times during her training. She'd read every paper on xenoanthropology that humanity had ever produced. But nothing—*nothing*—had prepared her for the reality of sitting across from genuinely alien beings, exchanging information about two entirely different evolutionary paths, two entirely different civilizations, and realizing with growing amazement that despite everything, *communication was possible*.

The Auruleans wanted to know everything about Earth. How humans survived the predator pressure. Why humanity's technological development was so absurdly fast. How the ForreFold Drive was even theoretically possible—the Aurulean scientists became visibly excited when Chen explained the four-micro-sun power generation system, several of them speaking rapidly in their own language and gesturing with their hands in ways that Chen instinctively recognized as *technical discussion*.

In return, the humans learned about the Coalition. One hundred and fourteen thousand years of spacefaring civilization. Sixty-two member species, all of them from planets in the optimal habitable zone: zero-point-one to zero-point-eight Earth masses. The Quantum Slip Drive that allowed faster-than-light travel by folding space through dimensional shortcuts—elegant, mathematically pure, and according to Velix, fundamentally limited by energy requirements.

"Our drives are efficient," Velix explained, "but they require massive infrastructure. Dyson swarms for power collection. Decades to establish the necessary systems. Your ForreFold Drive, though... four miniature stars. Portable. Self-contained. Captain Webb, do you understand how revolutionary this is? Your species compressed stellar-scale energy production into a ship-mounted system. The engineering alone is..." Velix made a gesture that the translator labeled as "[profound respect/amazement]".

Webb smiled slightly. "We call it practicality over design. When you've only got three thousand years of spacefaring history and you're working from scratch, you don't have time for elegance. You build what works."

"Three thousand years," another Aurulean—introduced as Science Principal Kelvix—interjected. "Captain, our species required ninety-eight thousand years to achieve interstellar capability from the development of writing. You did it in three thousand. How?"

Chen leaned forward. "Death World pressure, Science Principal. We didn't have the luxury of slow development. Earth throws natural disasters at us constantly. Predators that can kill humans trivially. Diseases that evolve to overcome our immune systems. We innovate rapidly because if we don't, we die. It's made us very good at solving problems quickly."

"But the psychological cost—" Kelvix started.

"Is significant," Chen admitted. "Humans suffer from anxiety disorders, trauma responses, stress-related illnesses at rates you probably find horrifying. We evolved those traits because they kept us alive. Constant threat assessment. Hypervigilance. The ability to function under extreme pressure. We're not built for peace, Science Principal. We're built for survival."

The Auruleans exchanged glances. Chen couldn't read their expressions, but the body language suggested something like... pity? No, not quite. Understanding, maybe. Or concern.

"And yet," Velix said slowly, "you came through the Dead Zone to find us. Not to conquer. Not to threaten. But to... what? Talk?"

Webb nodded. "To talk. To learn. To discover if we're alone. For three thousand years, we've stared at empty skies and wondered. The Obscuration Zone made it impossible to see you, and you couldn't see us. We were isolated, not by choice but by cosmic circumstance. When we finally developed technology that could break through, we came looking. Because humans are curious, First Administrator. It's one of our defining traits. We want to know what's out there. We want to understand. And yes—we want friends."

"Friends." Velix tested the word. "With Death Worlders."

"With anyone willing," Webb said simply.

Silence fell over the conference chamber. Chen could see the Auruleans processing this, weighing humanity's words against their own trauma from the Baegk war. Three hundred years of genocide. Three founding species completely extinct. The Coalition teetering on the edge of collapse from an enemy they couldn't defeat.

And now, from the Dead Zone, came another Death World species. Asking to be friends.

Finally, Velix stood. "Captain Webb, your delegation may remain aboard Station Primarch until the Coalition Council session. We will provide appropriate accommodations. I must be honest—I do not know what the Council will decide. You are... unprecedented. Your technology is beyond ours in specific ways. Your physical capabilities are formidable. You are, in every measurable way, exactly the kind of species that the Coalition has learned to fear."

Webb stood as well, carefully, slowly. "What will you recommend to the Council, First Administrator?"

Velix looked up at him—and Chen realized the Aurulean had to tilt their head back at an almost ninety-degree angle to meet his eyes. The size difference was staggering.

"I will recommend," Velix said, "that we give you a chance. One chance. You have crossed the void to meet us. The least we can do is listen. But Captain Webb, understand this: if humanity proves to be another Baegk, the Coalition will respond with everything we have. We will not allow another Death World genocide."

"Understood," Webb said. "And for what it's worth, First Administrator—if we encounter these Baegk of yours, and if they're everything you say they are... they'll find out that not all Death Worlders are the same."

## PART FOUR: THE COUNCIL SESSION

Six "standard intervals" turned out to be roughly eighteen hours, enough time for the human delegation to rest, eat ration packs from *Tenacity* (the Auruleans apologetically explained that they had no idea how to prepare food for beings with human biochemistry), and prepare for what was essentially humanity's first job interview with galactic civilization.

Chen spent most of that time reviewing everything she could access about Coalition structure, culture, and history. The Auruleans had provided access to their public data networks, and she'd immediately tasked three of *Tenacity's* AI systems with translation and analysis.

What she learned was both encouraging and terrifying.

The Coalition was ancient. Not just the one-hundred-fourteen-thousand years they'd mentioned, but truly *ancient*—records stretched back over two hundred thousand years, to the first contact between the Auruleans and the Veltriks, the second-oldest spacefaring species. The growth had been slow but steady: species after species joining as they achieved interstellar capability, all of them from that optimal habitable zone, all of them small and peaceful by nature.

Their technology was mature. Quantum Slip Drives that could cross the galaxy in weeks. Matter replication systems that made resource scarcity obsolete. Medical science that extended lifespans to three or four hundred years for most species. Cultural achievements that made Earth's greatest civilizations look like crude first attempts.

But militarily? The Coalition was losing.

The Baegk had appeared fifty thousand years ago—roughly when humanity was just figuring out how to work with bronze. They came from a planet one-point-four Earth masses, with surface gravity of twelve-point-three meters per second squared. Death World Class-Twelve, even more extreme than Earth. And unlike every other intelligent species the Coalition had encountered, the Baegk had evolved from apex predators rather than prey.

They didn't negotiate. They didn't trade. They conquered. They consumed. They expanded. And their biology—insectoid, rapid reproduction, hive-mind coordination—made them nearly impossible to defeat through conventional warfare.

Three hundred years of war. Three Coalition species extinct. The Baegk slowly, inexorably, pushing toward the Coalition core worlds.

And now humanity had shown up, looking superficially similar to the Baegk in all the ways that mattered to terrified Coalition citizens: large, dense, from a Death World, possessing technology that shouldn't exist.

No wonder they were scared.

"Dr. Chen," Webb's voice pulled her from the data analysis. "Time to go. They're ready for us."

The Coalition Council Chamber was unlike anything Chen had ever seen. It was a massive sphere, maybe two hundred meters in diameter, with the actual chamber floor at the center. Rising around it in concentric circles were hundreds of platforms—each one sized for a different Coalition member species, each one equipped with translation systems and holographic displays.

And every single one of them was occupied.

This wasn't just the official council. This was *everyone*. Every species that could get a representative here on short notice had done so. Chen saw Auruleans, of course, but also dozens of other forms: beings that looked like ambulatory plants, crystalline structures that might have been silicon-based life, things that defied easy categorization but were clearly intelligent and technological.

All of them small. All of them staring at the human delegation as they entered.

The humans had been given a platform at ground level—the largest in the chamber, hastily constructed with human-scale furniture and structural support. They stood out like giants among children, which Chen supposed was exactly what they were.

Webb led the delegation to their position with the same careful, measured movements they'd practiced. Sit slowly. Speak softly. Appear non-threatening while also projecting confidence. It was an exhausting balancing act.

Velix appeared on a platform elevated to human eye level, speaking in their musical language. The translation came through a moment later: "Representatives of the Galactic Coalition, we are gathered to assess a petition for contact status from a newly encountered species. I present Captain Marcus Webb and delegation, representing humanity, Democratic Alliance of Geological Republics, originating from planet Earth, Sol System."

A ripple went through the chamber. Chen saw beings leaning toward each other, speaking in low voices. Some of the platforms had holographic displays showing what were clearly data readouts—probably the information packages humanity had transmitted.

Another being stepped forward—this one taller than the Auruleans but still barely reaching human knee height. Velix had briefed them: this was Grand Arbiter Thule of the Veltriks, second-founding species of the Coalition, known for their logical and somewhat cold approach to decision-making.

"Captain Webb," Thule's translator rendered their voice as gender-neutral and precise. "We have reviewed your species' data. Planet Earth: five-point-nine-seven-two times ten to the twenty-fourth kilograms. Surface gravity nine-point-eight-zero-seven meters per second squared. Death World Class-Ten classification by our standards. You are aware that only one other Death World species has achieved interstellar capability in Coalition-documented history?"

"We are, Grand Arbiter," Webb replied. "The Baegk. First Administrator Velix informed us of their... actions."

"Actions." Thule made a sound like grinding metal. "An interesting euphemism for three hundred years of genocide, Captain. The Baegk have destroyed three of our founding species completely. Billions of sentients erased from existence. They cannot be reasoned with, cannot be negotiated with, and have proven resistant to every military response we have attempted. And now you arrive, from another Death World, possessing technology that our finest scientists claim should be impossible. You see our concern."

Webb nodded slowly. "I do, Grand Arbiter. But I would point out a few key differences. First, we came looking for you—we didn't attack. Second, we responded to your transmissions with peaceful intent and full disclosure. Third, we've demonstrated a willingness to follow your protocols and respect your customs, despite significant physical incompatibility. And fourth..." He paused, making eye contact with as many of the council representatives as he could. "We are not the Baegk. Different evolution. Different psychology. Different values."

"So you claim," Thule said. "But Death World species share certain traits, do they not? Enhanced physical capabilities. Aggressive tendencies. Resistance to environmental hazards that would kill Coalition citizens trivially. Captain Webb, you are ten times the size of the average Coalition citizen. Your bone density is three times ours. Your muscle mass per unit body size is unprecedented. You are, by every measurable standard, built for violence."

Chen felt the words like a physical blow. Built for violence. Not *capable of* violence, but *built for* it. As if humanity had no other purpose.

But Webb's expression didn't change. "With respect, Grand Arbiter, you're looking at the hardware without considering the software. Yes, humans evolved under extreme predator pressure. Yes, we're physically formidable by your standards. But we didn't survive Earth by being the strongest or the most aggressive. We survived by being *smart*. By cooperating. By forming alliances. By protecting each other. Every human advancement—tools, agriculture, medicine, space travel—came from our ability to work together despite our capacity for violence, not because of it."

"A compelling argument," another voice joined the discussion. This being was even smaller than the Auruleans, barely twelve centimeters tall, with a crystalline body that refracted light into prismatic patterns. The translator identified them as Elder Portavian, though it gave no further designation. "But perhaps the question is not whether you are capable of peace, Captain Webb. Perhaps the question is whether the Coalition can afford the risk of trusting you. We are ancient. We are established. We have achieved a stable civilization that has endured for over one hundred thousand years. What do we gain from admitting a Death World species that might, in time, prove as dangerous as the Baegk?"

Webb was quiet for a moment. Chen could see him thinking, weighing his words. This was the heart of it. Not whether humanity was good or evil, peaceful or violent—but whether the Coalition could risk association with beings who were simply too dangerous by their very nature.

"What do you gain?" Webb finally said. "You gain perspective. You've been spacefaring for a hundred thousand years, and in all that time, you've encountered only species from optimal habitable worlds. You've built a civilization on the assumption that intelligent life develops slowly, peacefully, under minimal environmental pressure. And that's worked—until the Baegk. Now you're facing a threat that doesn't follow your rules, doesn't respond to your diplomacy, and is slowly destroying everything you've built. What do you gain from us? You gain someone who understands how Death Worlders think. How we fight. How we survive. Because we did it too, Elder—we clawed our way up from a planet that tried to kill us every single day. We know what it takes."

"Are you offering your services as mercenaries?" Thule asked, voice cold.

"No," Webb said firmly. "We're offering friendship. Partnership. We're offering to share what we know, what we've learned, what we've built. The ForreFold Drive, for instance—our scientists would be happy to collaborate with yours, help you understand the principles. But more than that, we're offering a different way of thinking. You've had a hundred thousand years to develop incrementally. We've had three thousand years of desperation-fueled innovation. Both approaches have value. Together, we might achieve things neither of us could alone."

The chamber erupted in discussion. Dozens of species talking at once, their translators creating a cacophony of overlapping voices. Chen caught fragments: "—unprecedented technology—" "—cannot trust Death Worlders—" "—but the ForreFold Drive could change—" "—Baegk precedent suggests—" "—they crossed the Dead Zone, that has to mean—"

Velix raised their small hand, and the chamber gradually quieted. "Captain Webb, the Coalition Council will need time to deliberate. However, I believe a preliminary vote is in order. This vote will not be binding, merely advisory. The question before us: Should humanity be granted provisional contact status, with the understanding that full membership would require extensive evaluation and trial period?"

Another Aurulean—Chen recognized them from the briefing materials as Coalition High Chancellor Morvik—spoke up. "I would like to propose an amendment to that question, First Administrator. Contact status typically implies full access to Coalition space, technology exchange, and participation in our commercial networks. Given humanity's... unusual nature... I suggest we offer something more limited. Provisional status with restricted access. Humans may dock at Coalition facilities, but with priority given to established members. They may access public data networks, but sensitive information remains classified. They may trade, but under tariff structures that account for the risk premium of Death World dealings."

Chen felt her stomach sink. They were going to let humanity in—but as second-class members. The species you tolerated, not the ones you welcomed.

Webb's jaw tightened fractionally, but his voice remained level. "Chancellor Morvik, I appreciate the proposal. But I have to ask: if we're deemed too dangerous for full access, what exactly is the point of contact status? We came through the Dead Zone hoping to join galactic civilization, not to be treated as permanent outsiders."

"Then perhaps," Morvik said with what the translator labeled as "[regret]", "you should have evolved on a less dangerous world, Captain. We do not make these restrictions out of malice. We make them out of necessity. The Baegk have taught us to be cautious with Death Worlders."

"We are not the Baegk," Webb repeated, but Chen could hear the frustration creeping into his voice.

"So you say. But the Baegk said much the same when they first made contact, fifty thousand years ago. They spoke of peace and cooperation. They demonstrated remarkable technology. They seemed, for a brief time, like they might be different. And then they began their expansion. Captain Webb, I truly do believe you mean well. But I cannot—*will not*—risk another Coalition species to prove you right."

The vote was called. Chen watched the holographic displays light up around the chamber, each platform indicating their position.

When the count finished, the results were damning: forty-seven in favor of restricted provisional status, two opposed, thirteen abstentions.

Not a single vote for full membership status.

Velix looked at Webb, and Chen could see genuine sympathy in those large eyes. "Captain Webb, by majority vote, humanity is granted restricted provisional contact status. You may operate within Coalition space, but subject to the limitations Chancellor Morvik outlined. This status will be reviewed after a trial period of ten standard cycles—approximately five Earth years—at which point the Council will reassess based on humanity's behavior and integration progress."

Webb stood. Carefully. Slowly. Making sure every movement was controlled and non-threatening even though Chen could see the anger in the set of his shoulders. "Thank you, First Administrator. We accept the Council's decision. But I want to state, for the record, that humanity came here in peace. We will continue to operate in peace. And when your trial period expires, we will have proven that not all Death Worlders are monsters."

"I hope you are correct, Captain," Velix said. "For all our sakes."

## PART FIVE: THE REALITY OF SECOND-CLASS STATUS

The human delegation returned to *Tenacity* in silence. No one spoke during the shuttle ride. No one spoke as they filed back onto their ship. Not until they were in the conference room, door sealed, did anyone say anything.

Chen spoke first. "Restricted provisional status."

"Second-class citizenship," Lieutenant Odinsson said bitterly. "That's what they gave us. The right to exist in their space, but with less priority than every other species."

"They're scared," one of the xenobiologists—Dr. Amara Singh—said. "Can we blame them? The Baegk destroyed three founding species. From their perspective—"

"From their perspective, we're guilty until proven innocent," Webb cut her off. "Punished for how we evolved. For the planet we came from. For circumstances completely beyond our control."

Chen pulled up the full text of the restrictions on the conference room display. As she read through them, her heart sank further. "It's worse than we thought. Listen to this: 'Human vessels are granted docking access at Coalition facilities, but priority sequencing places them below all established member species and civilian traffic. Estimated wait times may exceed standard operational windows.' Translation: we sit in queue for days while everyone else gets priority."

"There's more," Odinsson added, scrolling through his own copy. "Trade tariffs: twenty-five percent premium on all human transactions, designated as 'risk mitigation fee.' Technology exchange: humans may access public databases but are prohibited from downloading restricted technical specifications—which apparently includes about sixty percent of Coalition knowledge. Residential restrictions: humans are not permitted to establish permanent settlements on Coalition worlds without specific authorization from local governments, which requires... oh, this is lovely... unanimous approval from resident species populations."

"Unanimous," Singh repeated. "They've made it effectively impossible for humans to ever integrate. One person says no, we're blocked."

Webb was very quiet, staring at the display with an expression Chen couldn't quite read. Finally: "They've created a system where we're legally allowed to exist, but practically prevented from thriving. Smart, actually. They can claim they gave humanity a chance while making sure we never get comfortable enough to be a threat."

"So what do we do?" Chen asked.

Webb was silent for a long moment, then: "We adapt. That's what humans do, right? We've survived three billion years of evolution on a Death World. We can survive some bureaucratic discrimination." He stood, and Chen saw the determination settling over him like armor. "Here's what's going to happen. First, we do not—under any circumstances—give them an excuse to revoke even this limited status. We follow every rule. We pay every tariff. We wait in every queue. We are model provisional members, because the moment we step out of line, they'll use it as proof that Death Worlders can't be trusted."

"Sir, some of those restrictions are designed to be impossible to comply with," Odinsson protested.

"Then we do the impossible. Again." Webb smiled, but it wasn't a pleasant expression. "Second, we adapt our operations to work around their system. They don't want us at Coalition ports? Fine. We'll find private operators, independent stations, anyone willing to deal with humans outside the official channels. They want to charge us tariffs? We'll factor it into our economics. They won't share technology? We'll develop our own, like we've always done."

"That's... going to take resources," Singh said carefully.

"Then we'll go get resources. The Dead Zone—our space, the region between the Obscuration Zone and Sol—is still unclaimed by Coalition law. They can't see it, can't access it easily, consider it worthless. We'll build there. Colonies. Stations. Infrastructure. Human space, under human control, where we don't need their permission for anything."

Chen nodded slowly, seeing where he was going. "And in five years, when they review our status..."

"We'll have proven we can thrive despite their restrictions. We'll have shown we're peaceful, law-abiding, and valuable. And if they still won't grant full membership?" Webb's smile turned sharp. "Then we'll have built a civilization that doesn't need them."

"Sir," Chen said carefully, "that sounds dangerously close to isolationism. We came through the Obscuration Zone to join galactic civilization, not to build our own competing faction."

"Did we?" Webb challenged. "Or did we come to discover if we were alone, and if not, to find our place among the stars? Dr. Chen, they've made their position clear: we're tolerated, not welcomed. We're the necessary evil they'll deal with because they're too civilized to outright refuse us. Fine. We'll be the necessary evil. But we'll also be successful, independent, and absolutely certain that when the next crisis comes—and it will come—they'll remember who showed them how Death Worlders handle adversity."

"The Baegk," Odinsson said. "You're thinking about the Baegk."

"I'm thinking that a civilization locked in a three-hundred-year losing war against Death World aggressors might eventually realize that the best weapon against a Death Worlder is another Death Worlder. One who's on their side. But first, we have to survive long enough to prove we're worth keeping around."

Webb turned to face the entire delegation. "Here's the mission moving forward: we expand human presence in the Dead Zone. We establish contact with independent operators in Coalition space. We build relationships with species who are willing to look past the Death World classification. We pay our tariffs with a smile, wait in their queues without complaint, and follow every single rule they've set. And we do it all while maintaining the truth: humans came in peace, humans remain in peace, and humans will not apologize for evolving on Earth."

Chen felt something settle in her chest. Not anger, exactly. Not even resentment. Just... determination. "Practicality over design," she said.

"Always," Webb agreed. "We survived Earth by being practical. We'll survive this the same way."

## PART SIX: THE NICKNAMES

Within two months, human vessels had become a common sight in Coalition space—or at least, as common as second-class provisional members could be. DAGR had authorized a dozen additional ships to make the crossing through the Obscuration Zone, and the ForreFold Drive technology proved reliable enough that the journey, while still dangerous, was becoming routine.

And with increased human presence came increased awareness among Coalition citizens. Which led, inevitably, to names.

Chen first heard about it from a Velrik merchant she'd been negotiating with at Independent Station Kepler-42, a private facility that didn't enforce Coalition priority docking. The merchant—small, insectoid in appearance but with surprisingly expressive antennae—had been explaining why their prices for refined metals were higher than Coalition standard rates.

"Death Worlder surcharge," the merchant said apologetically. "Is not personal, understand? But facilities must be reinforced. Standard Coalition materials not rated for your mass. Furniture, floor panels, airlocks—all must be upgraded. This costs credits."

"I understand," Chen said, though she didn't, really. Humans weren't *that* much heavier. But the merchant's translation device seemed functional, and the sentiment was clear enough. "We're willing to pay fair prices."

"Fair, yes. Is good you are reasonable about this. Some of my colleagues, they refuse to deal with..." The merchant's antennae twitched uncertainly. "Is difficult to translate. Coalition common tongue has many words for your species now. Not all polite."

Chen felt her stomach tighten. "What kind of words?"

The merchant looked uncomfortable—or at least, performed the behavior that Chen's xenopsychology training identified as discomfort in Velrik body language. "Official designation is 'Death Zone Death Worlders,' from your origin beyond Obscuration barrier. But on communication networks, you are called..." The antennae drooped apologetically. "Demons. Reapers. Cave Men of the Void. Flying Pigs."

"Flying Pigs?" Chen couldn't help the incredulous tone.

"Your ships. Are... how to explain? Coalition vessels are curves, elegance, artistic beauty in propulsion systems. Your vessels are..." The merchant gestured vaguely. "Boxes with weapons. Very practical, very functional, but aesthetic is... is like flying pigs. Ugly but somehow working anyway."

Chen reported this conversation to Captain Webb that evening, expecting anger. Instead, he laughed.

"Flying Pigs," he repeated, grinning. "You know what? I like it. It's honest. Our ships *are* ugly by their standards. We didn't have a hundred thousand years to make propulsion artistic. We built what worked, and if it looks like a pig with a ForreFold Drive strapped to its back, so be it."

"Sir, they're mocking us."

"They're *afraid* of us, Dr. Chen. The mockery is how they cope with that fear. Think about it: Demons. Reapers. Death Worlders. These aren't insults about our competence or intelligence. They're expressions of terror wrapped in disdain. And you know what?" Webb's grin turned sharp. "Let them be scared. Let them think we're monsters from the void. Because when the Baegk come knocking—and they will, eventually—the Coalition will remember that monsters can be useful."

Over the following weeks, Chen watched as Webb's philosophy spread through the human crews. Someone on the *Valiant*—one of the newer vessels to cross the Obscuration Zone—painted a crude reaper's scythe on their ship's hull. It was meant as a joke, a middle finger to the species calling them "Reapers." But the image spread. Other ships added their own versions. Scythes. Skulls. Gothic imagery that humans had associated with death for millennia.

The Coalition species who saw these vessels arriving at stations reacted with visible fear. Which, Chen realized with growing unease, was exactly what was happening. Humans were leaning into the reputation. Making themselves look more threatening, not less.

She confronted Webb about it over a private comm channel. "Sir, this is counterproductive. We're supposed to be proving we're peaceful. Painting death imagery on our ships sends the opposite message."

Webb's response came through with what sounded like hammering in the background—he was probably in one of the engineering bays. "Dr. Chen, answer me honestly: is there anything we could paint on our hulls that would make a seventeen-centimeter-tall Aurulean less afraid of one-point-seven-five-meter-tall humans? Could we cover our ships in flowers and rainbows and have it make a difference?"

Chen opened her mouth to argue, then stopped. Thought about it. "No," she finally admitted. "The size difference alone is terrifying to them. The Death World classification compounds it. They're scared of what we are, not what we paint on our ships."

"Exactly. So if they're going to be scared anyway, we might as well control the narrative. They want to call us Demons? Fine. We're demons. They want to call us Reapers? Great. We're reapers. But here's the key: we're *their* demons. Their reapers. On their side, following their rules, paying their tariffs. We're the scary thing that's pointed away from them. And when something scarier shows up—say, a genocidal insectoid hive-mind from Death World Class-Twelve—they'll be very glad to have demons on their side."

Chen still wasn't sure about the strategy, but she couldn't deny the logic. And when the *Indomitable*—the largest human vessel yet built, a proper dreadnought at two-point-four kilometers long—crossed through the Obscuration Zone and docked at Station Primarch, its hull covered in stylized scythes and what could only be described as intimidation imagery, she watched the Aurulean reaction.

Fear, yes. But also something else. A kind of... anticipation? Like watching a dangerous animal in a cage, safely contained but powerful. The kind of power you didn't want aimed at you, but might be useful aimed at your enemies.

Velix sent a private message to Webb that evening: "Your species has interesting approach to public relations, Captain. Very... direct."

Webb's response, which he cc'd to Chen, was brief: "We are what we are, First Administrator. We won't apologize for it. But we'll always be on the right side."

The third month after first contact, a new ship design rolled out of human shipyards in the Dead Zone. The engineers had taken the "Flying Pigs" nickname literally. They'd redesigned the standard human destroyer—already a functional, blocky design—to emphasize the insult.

The result was the Warthog-class Heavy Cruiser.

It had a reinforced prow that genuinely looked like tusks. The hull was segmented in a way that resembled armored hide. The engine configuration, when viewed from certain angles, could be interpreted as a pig's hindquarters. It was ugly, brutal, and absolutely functional—packed with weapons, armor, and four ForreFold Drives that made it faster and more maneuverable than anything in the Coalition fleet.

When the first Warthog arrived at a Coalition trade station, Chen watched the live feed from her office aboard *Tenacity*. The station's automated docking system tried to route it to the standard queue—estimated wait time: forty-two hours.

The Warthog's captain—a woman named Helena Vasquez who Chen had met once and found both terrifying and inspiring—sent back a polite message: "Understood, Station Control. However, we note that Independent Dock Seven is currently unoccupied and would suit our requirements. We're happy to pay the independent operator's rates."

She took the ship to the independent dock, paid triple the Coalition rate without complaint, and got her crew docked, refueled, and back into space in eight hours instead of forty-two.

Other human captains took note. Within a week, Coalition docking queues were half-empty because human vessels had systematically identified every independent operator, private station, and non-Coalition facility in their operational area and started using those instead.

The Coalition standard discount—twenty-five percent off at official facilities—meant nothing when you saved three days of waiting. The tariffs meant nothing when independent operators didn't charge them.

And the Coalition bureaucrats, Chen learned through her intelligence contacts, were quietly panicking because their carefully designed system of restrictions was accomplishing nothing except pushing humans toward building their own parallel infrastructure.

Captain Webb's log entry from that week summed it up perfectly:

*"They treat us like the galactic joke. The giant oafs from the void. We are not treated unkindly—no violence, no overt hostility. But we are outsiders. We are not one of them.*

*Fine.*

*We earned our right to civilization through survival of the fittest. Homo sapiens was birthed through fire and flame, and we came out unscathed. We are giants. We are different. We'll keep to ourselves and do what made us successful in the first place: Practicality over design.*

    *Let them laugh. We'll keep building."*

## PART SEVEN: MEETING THE PORTAVIANS (Year 4)

The message came through official Coalition channels, which was unusual enough that Chen's AI assistant flagged it as priority. She was in her quarters aboard *Tenacity*, reviewing the latest economic projections for human trade networks, when the notification appeared.

"Dr. Chen, you're receiving a communication request from an unknown Coalition species. Translation protocols indicate Portavian origin. Shall I establish connection?"

Portavian. Chen didn't recognize the name, which meant they were either very minor or very isolated. She approved the connection.

The holographic display resolved into an image of the smallest being Chen had ever seen. Twelve centimeters tall—shorter even than the Auruleans—with a body that appeared to be made of living crystal. Light refracted through its form in prismatic patterns, giving it an ethereal, almost unreal quality. Large eyes, proportionally huge, regarded her with what seemed like intense curiosity rather than fear.

"Dr. Sarah Chen," the translator rendered the being's voice as soft and musical. "I am Research Coordinator Kelthrix of Primity, representing the Portavian Computational Collective. We have been observing your species' integration with great interest. Would you be available for academic exchange?"

Academic exchange. Not trade negotiations, not diplomatic protocols, not risk assessment. Just... science.

Chen felt something unclench in her chest that she hadn't realized was tight. "Research Coordinator, I would be delighted. What field of study interests you?"

"All of them," Kelthrix said, and Chen could swear the crystal being was smiling. "But primarily: how did you break through the Obscuration Zone? We have theoretical models for that region's interference patterns, but they all suggest penetration is impossible without energy expenditures that would require stellar-scale infrastructure. Yet you arrived in a single vessel. This fascinates us."

Over the next six hours, Chen found herself in the most intellectually stimulating conversation she'd had since leaving Earth. Kelthrix wasn't just asking questions—they were *engaged*. Genuinely interested. They wanted to understand the mathematics, the engineering principles, the creative leaps that let humanity miniaturize fusion reactors and weaponize gravity.

And in return, they shared. Portavian computational theory was centuries ahead of anything humanity had developed. They'd built megastructures around their star—entire orbital shells dedicated to processing power, running simulations of universal physics that would take human computers millennia to complete.

"We seek to answer fundamental questions," Kelthrix explained. "Why does existence exist? What are the underlying rules? How can consciousness emerge from matter? These are not practical questions, Dr. Chen. They have no economic value, no military application. But they are *important*."

"How long have your people been working on these questions?" Chen asked.

"Five hundred thousand years, give or take. We are... older than most Coalition species. We achieved spaceflight when the Auruleans were still developing agriculture. But we had no interest in expansion, in politics, in the games of power that drive younger civilizations. We sought only understanding."

Chen did the mental math and felt dizzy. Five hundred thousand years. Earth's entire recorded human history was maybe ten thousand years. The Portavians had been pondering the nature of existence since before Homo sapiens even existed as a species.

"And in all that time," Chen said carefully, "you've made progress?"

"Some," Kelthrix's crystal body shimmered in what might have been amusement. "We have ruled out approximately forty-three percent of the theoretical possibility space for universal origin. This is considered acceptable progress. We have another million years of computational runtime scheduled."

"You're going to spend a million years on a single question?"

"Of course. What else would we spend it on?"

Chen laughed. She couldn't help it. Here was a species so advanced, so ancient, that they made the Coalition look young—and they were spending their time on pure philosophy. No weapons development. No territorial expansion. Just the patient, endless pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.

"Research Coordinator, I think I'd like to introduce you to our other scientists. Would you be interested in a broader exchange program?"

"Very much so. But Dr. Chen..." Kelthrix's large eyes seemed to focus more intently. "I must ask. You are from a Death World. You evolved under conditions we cannot imagine surviving. The Coalition fears you because of this. Why do you pursue knowledge instead of conquest? It would be so easy for beings of your physical capabilities."

Chen considered the question seriously. "Because we're curious," she finally said. "Yes, we're physically strong compared to most galactic citizens. Yes, we came from a harsh world. But that's not what defines us. What defines us is that we look at something we don't understand and immediately want to figure it out. We crossed the Obscuration Zone not because we needed to, but because we wanted to know what was on the other side. We're here talking to you not because it benefits us economically or strategically, but because you're fascinating and we want to learn. Curiosity is as fundamental to humans as breathing."

"Curiosity," Kelthrix repeated. "The Baegk have no curiosity. They consume. They expand. They destroy. But you..."

"Are not the Baegk," Chen finished. "We're really not, Research Coordinator. And I hope, in time, the Coalition will understand that."

"Perhaps we can help with that understanding," Kelthrix said. "The Portavians have some influence with the Coalition Council. We are respected for our age and our wisdom, if not our relevance to current affairs. If we were to... advocate for humanity's full membership..."

Chen felt hope kindle. "Would you do that?"

"We would need to know you better first. Your species is young—barely three thousand years of spaceflight. But you achieved in millennia what took us epochs. You broke through the Obscuration Zone using gravitational manipulation—a solution we never considered because we thought it impossible to miniaturize stellar fusion." Kelthrix's body shimmered again. "You are not primitive, Dr. Chen. You are lateral thinkers. We could learn from each other."

And they did.

Over the following months, human scientists established regular contact with Portavian research collectives. The exchanges were purely academic—no politics, no trade negotiations, just the free flow of ideas between species who valued knowledge for its own sake.

The Portavians shared their computational models. Humans shared ForreFold Drive principles. Portavians demonstrated exotic materials synthesis. Humans showed rapid prototyping methodologies. It was collaboration in the purest sense, two civilizations with completely different evolutionary paths finding common ground in curiosity.

Chen presented her first joint paper with Kelthrix to the Coalition Scientific Assembly in Year 4: "Gravitational Manipulation via Localized Stellar Fusion: Theoretical Frameworks and Practical Applications." The assembly was held at Station Primarch, in a chamber that had been modified to accommodate human physicality while allowing holographic attendance from across Coalition space.

The paper was... controversial.

Half the assembled scientists—primarily those from long-established species—dismissed it as dangerous speculation. Weaponizing gravity? Miniaturizing stars? These were not things responsible civilizations pursued. These were Death World ideas, aggressive and reckless.

But the other half—younger species, independent researchers, and notably, the Portavians—were electrified. The questions came rapid-fire:

"Dr. Chen, if we scaled the ForreFold Drive down, could it be used for localized gravity manipulation in zero-g construction?"

"Research Coordinator Kelthrix, your computational models suggest the approach could be adapted to other frequency ranges—what about quantum entanglement manipulation?"

"Captain Webb—yes, I know you're not a scientist, but you commanded the first vessel through the Obscuration Zone—what were the subjective effects of the spacetime folding? Did your crew report any unusual perceptual phenomena?"

It went on for eight hours. At the end, exhausted but exhilarated, Chen found herself surrounded by researchers from a dozen different species, all of them wanting to collaborate, all of them seeing humans not as threats but as partners in the endless quest to understand the universe.

Kelthrix approached her as the chamber was emptying. "Dr. Chen, the Portavians would like to make a formal proposal to the Coalition Council. We wish to invite human researchers to Primity—our homeworld—for long-term collaborative study. This would require waiving the residential restrictions currently placed on your species. We are prepared to argue that scientific collaboration serves the greater good of all Coalition members."

Chen felt tears prick her eyes. She hadn't realized how much the restrictions had been weighing on her until someone offered to lift them. "Research Coordinator, that would be... we would be honored."

"The honor is ours," Kelthrix said. "You are young, yes. Loud and aggressive and sometimes frighteningly direct. But you are also brilliant, innovative, and possessed of a perspective we desperately need. The Coalition has become stagnant, Dr. Chen. A hundred thousand years of slow, careful progress. You represent change. Uncomfortable, chaotic, necessary change. And we are very glad you found us."

For the first time since arriving in Coalition space, Chen felt welcomed. Not tolerated, not feared, not grudgingly accepted—but genuinely, warmly welcomed.

It was a feeling she'd almost forgotten was possible.
