# Chapter 3 Timeline

Hour 0: Baegk Extinction-Class fleet (3,400 bioships, 14M warriors) arrives at Sol System heliopause. Broadcast: "Prey-species extermination proceeding." Flint addresses DAGR fleet: "Not a single Baegk reaches Earth."

Hours 0-7: Defensive Sphere One engagement at Mars orbit. Human dreadnoughts weaponize ForreFold gravity wells, disrupt Baegk swarm coordination (97% cohesion drops to 22%). Railguns at 0.3c shatter organic armor. 147 bioships destroyed in opening engagement. Baegk adapt: disperse formation, close for boarding.

Hours 7-14: Baegk boarding actions across 40 human vessels. Expected outcome: human defenders overwhelmed. Actual outcome: Baegk warriors destroyed in CQC. Death World physiology (bone density, muscle efficiency, pack tactics) vs predator evolution (hive-mind reliance, swarm doctrine). Example: Sgt. Rodriguez's squad eliminates 40 Baegk warriors, zero human casualties. Boarding doctrine fails completely.

Hours 14-32: Defensive Sphere Two/Three operations. Human dreadnoughts concentrate 356 ForreFold Drives on individual Hive-Command vessels, generating 47g variance across 5km lengths. Gravitational shear rips coordination nodes apart. All 50 Hive-Command vessels systematically eliminated. Baegk fleet loses centralized coordination. Remaining bioships scatter—some flee, some advance, some drift. Cleanup operations eliminate advancing vessels.

Final Statistics: 92% Baegk casualties (3,127 ships), 2.6% human casualties (183 ships, 47,000 KIA). Portavian civilian casualties: ZERO. Coalition predictions (human extinction in 48 hours): Wrong. Battle duration: 32 hours. Greater Good Initiative: Vindicated through blood and sacrifice.

Setup Complete: Stage set for Chapter Four (Epilogue)—Coalition emergency session, Aurulean public apology, technology sharing, Baegk War turns, human-Portavian integration complete, galaxy's new reality.
