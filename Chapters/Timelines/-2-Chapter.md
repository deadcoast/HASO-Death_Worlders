# Chapter 2 Timeline

Year 6: Prime Marshal Flint broadcasts Coalition-wide, invoking Greater Good Initiative. Portavians granted refugee status. Coalition response: protests, predictions of human annihilation. Ven-Tal-Kir (safely conducting research in Sol System) learns homeworld destroyed, volunteers to assist settlement preparations.

Year 6-7: Portavian Remnant Fleet crosses Obscuration Zone escorted by human vessels. 3.8 million survivors (400,000 died during flight) arrive at Earth. Captain Webb: "Welcome home." Settlement zones prepared in Pacific Northwest. Dr. Chen kneels for six hours during initial landing to appear less threatening.

Year 7-20: Integration golden era. Portavian-human technology sharing produces hybrid innovations (quantum-gravity computational matrices). Cultural normalization: children attend joint schools, Portavians ride human shoulders as symbol of friendship. Year 13: Major computational breakthrough proves civilizations separated by 500,000 years can build impossible technology together.

Year 26: Long-range sensors detect Baegk Extinction-Class fleet: 3,400+ bioships, 14 million warriors, 140 hours out. Coalition response: "Surrender Portavians to avoid escalation." Human response: "Fuck that." Flint mobilizes entire DAGR fleet (6,949 ships, 2.1M personnel). Six days to prepare. Sol System becomes defensive battleground.

Setup Complete: Stage set for Chapter Threeâ€”Battle of Sol, human advantages deployed (gravity warfare, railguns, CQC superiority), 47,000 human deaths defending 3.8M refugees, total Baegk annihilation.
